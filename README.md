- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Helenistic
- About 1 year ago, I started installing nodes. Such as Starknet, KYVE, Subspace, Massa, Minima. 
- I get enough node stability. Despite the fact that I have been dealing with nodes relatively recently, 
my distinguishing feature is that I quickly find errors. 

- My goal: to get into quality projects as a node operator. I will take a big step towards self-improvement, and my skill to get out of 
difficult situations will allow my node to be in the top positions.
